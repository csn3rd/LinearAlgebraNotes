# Linear Algebra Notes

These are my notes from taking MATH 53: Linear Algebra at Santa Clara University. The textbook used is Linear Algebra and its Applications (5th Edition) by David C. Lay, Judi J. McDonald, and Steven R. Lay. The theorems and definitions are from Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4.

Check the wiki to access the notes by chapter/section or check Notes.md for everything in one file.

All of these notes were typed by me so there will likely be typos. Let me know if you spot any.
